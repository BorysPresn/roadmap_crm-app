# CRM App (Final Roadmap Project)

This is my final project from the Frontend Developer roadmap.  
I’m building it to practice and combine everything I’ve learned so far.

## Overview
The app is designed as a simple CRM system for managing customers and business processes.  
Currently, it includes:
- User authentication  
- Page navigation  

## Tech Stack
- **React + TypeScript**
- **React Hook Form**, **React Query**
- **Vite**, **ESLint**, **Prettier**
- **Trello** for task management
- **GitHub** for version control

## Goal
To simulate a real development environment — task tracking, code reviews, pull requests, and project structure based on modern best practices.

## Status
Project is still in progress — more features are being developed and improved.
